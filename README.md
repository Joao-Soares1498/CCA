# CCA
Project Repository for CCA
The back-end and the front-end were developed separately so they are in diferent branches.

This project was started in a dicipline in my last year in Infomatics System Engeneering in IPCA.

The objective is o create a Web App that allows certain users to create, manage and submit their teachers evaluation.
The program is based in a login, where you access your private evaluations, the ones that are completed and the ones that are in development.
Another feature is trought a form create an evaluation and insert it in a model excel and save the data in the personal folder on the server.

The Back-end is developed in a MVC structure in C# and the front-end was developed with angular.

This project was set to be implemented with more features after the end of the graduation to be used by teachers. Some features were added but in the meantime it was dropped.
